## Usage

1. Press the 'New IBT' button to begin creating a new IBT.
	* Fill out the required details and press 'Create New'.
2. Then phone up/email a store and once they have confirmed that they will send the item, select your IBT from the table and press the 'Requested' button.
	* From there, select the store that it was requested from (and the date if it is different).
3. Once the IBT arrives in store, select the IBT and press the 'Add IBT Number' button.
	* Add the IBT Number in the format *00/0/0000* - this will be for future reference for management.
4. Then call the customer and press the 'Customer Called' button.
5. Once the IBT has been collected, mark the IBT as collected.

N.B. If you need to leave a note (e.g. left a message instead of actually speaking to the customer) then you can press the 'Add/Edit Note' button and add your note. People can then view this note by hovering over the first column of an IBT.

The management team, after checking off the IBT on the Goods In Dialog on the till, will need to select the IBT and press the 'Subwarehouse Check' button. This is so that you can keep track of what you have accepted onto your stock file.
